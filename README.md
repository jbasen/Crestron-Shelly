integrate with Shelly 1, Shelly 1PM, and Shelly 2.5 relays as well as the
Shelly EM energy monitor.  

V2 adds support for the new Shelly Motion detector

V3 adds support for the Shelly Uni

V5 fixes and issue with getting power from a Shelly 1PM and adds support for retreiving voltage readings from
each channel of a Shelly EM.  NOTE- THE POWER_METER_TYPE PARAMETER ON THE SHELLY RELAY MODULE HAS CHANGED
